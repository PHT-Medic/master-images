This repository contains all docker images, with which an analysis algorithm can be built.


## Structure

The `language` folder contains master images, which are built for a specific programming language.
On the other hand, the `custom` folder contains master images which might be project specific or 
aren't aimed for a specific language.

### Languages
The main supported programming languages at the moment are:
- Python
- R

The corresponding `language` directory in this repository, contains subdirectories with Dockerfiles and related resources required 
for building those images.
